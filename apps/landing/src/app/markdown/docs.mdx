# Documentation

**React Beauty Flags** is a simple React library that renders handmade flags for different topics as countries or cities. It provides an easy way to display flags in your React applications with minimal setup.

## Goal

As a frontend developer, I faced many times the need to display flags in my applications. I found that most libraries available were either **too complex or their designs were not visually appealing**. I wanted to create a set based on beautiful designs that would allow me and any developer to display flags with ease.

As a **Duolingo** user, I was inspired by their flag designs and decided to create a similar feeling for React applications.

You will find +250 flags, including countries, regions, cities, and symbols. The flags are designed with a unique style that makes them visually appealing and easy to recognize.

If you develop a bank or financial application, this might not be the best choice for you. However, if you are building a beautiful with modern UX design, this library is perfect for you. ðŸ˜€

## Features

- **Beautiful Designs**: The flags are handmade designed with a unique style that makes them visually appealing.
- **Easy to Use**: The library is simple to use and requires minimal setup.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the size of the flags by passing the width and height props, as well as other standard SVG props.
- **Utility Functions**: The library includes utility functions to help you work with flags, such as getting flag data by code or name.
- **Typescript Support**: The library is written in TypeScript, providing type safety and autocompletion in your IDE.

## Installation

To install React Beauty Flags, use your package manager of choice:

```bash
pnpm install react-beauty-flags
```

You can also use _npm_ or _yarn_:

<div className='gap-4 grid md:grid-cols-2'>
```bash
yarn add react-beauty-flags
```

```bash
npm install react-beauty-flags
```

</div>

## Usage

To use React Beauty Flags in your application, import theÂ **Flag**Â component and pass theÂ **code**Â prop to specify the country:

```jsx
import Flag from "react-beauty-flags"

const App = () => {
  return <Flag code="Es" />
}

export default App
```

If you want to enforce the flag code, you can use the **FlagsCodesEnum**:

```jsx
import Flag, { FlagsCodesEnum } from "react-beauty-flags"

export const App = () => {
  return <Flag code={FlagsCodesEnum.ES} /> // Ts will enforce a correct code
}
```

### Customizing the Size

The Flag is rendered by default with a width of **28px** and a height of **20px** (aspect ratio 1.4).

To customize the size, feel free to can pass both **width** and **height** props, even if you can pass any desired size, I heighly recommend keeping the aspect ratio (for possible shadows or bg colors) you can keep this relation using this formula (width = height \* 1.4).

To use a scale factor, you can multiply the default size by the desired factor:

```jsx
<Flag code="Es" width={28 * 1.3} height={20 * 1.3} />
```

Also you can pass only the width or height:

```jsx
<Flag code="Es" width={50} /> // This is also valid but the aspect ratio will be different
```

The easier way to change the size is to pass the width and height props directly:

```jsx
<Flag code="Es" width={200} height={140} />
```

## Direct Flag Render

All flags are available as a direct render, an alternative to the **Flag** component. This is useful when you need to render the flag directly in your JSX without using a component.

```jsx
import { ES } from "react-beauty-flags"
// Example in a component
const App = () => {
  return <ES />
}

// Example in a JSX
const App = () => {
  return <div>{ES}</div>
}

// Example in a styled component
const StyledFlag = styled.ES`
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
`


// Example in a static object
const flags = {
  es: ES,
  fr: FR,
  // ...
}

// Those examples are equivalent to <Flag code="Es" /> but with more control
```

## Props

The **Flag** component and the **direct imports** accepts the following props:

### code (required for the **Flag** component)

- **Type**: FlagCode (string)
- **Description**: The unique code for the flag you want to display. This should be one of the keys in **FlagsCodesEnum**.

Example:

```jsx
<Flag code="Fr" /> // Displays the French flag
```

### Additional SVG Props

Flag component or any direct component render also accepts all standard SVG props, allowing for further customization.

Example:

```jsx
<Flag code="Jp" title="Japan Flag" role="img" id="japan-flag" />
```

## **Utility Functions**

React Beauty Flags comes with several utility functions to help you work with flags.

### **getFlagByCode**

- **Type**: (code: FlagCode) => FlagData | undefined
- **Description**: Retrieves flag data by its code.

Example:

```js
import { getFlagByCode } from "react-beauty-flags"

const japanFlag = getFlagByCode("Jp")
console.log(japanFlag) // { code: "Jp", name: "Japan", type: "country" }
```

### getFlagByName

- **Type**: (name: string) => FlagData | undefined
- **Description**: Retrieves flag data by its name.

Example:

```js
import { getFlagByName } from "react-beauty-flags"

const franceFlag = getFlagByName("France")
console.log(franceFlag) // { code: "Fr", name: "France", type: "country" }
```

### **getFlagsByType**

- **Type**: (type: FlagType) => FlagData[]
- **Description**: Retrieves all flags of a specific type.

Example:

```js
import { getFlagsByType } from "react-beauty-flags"

const countryFlags = getFlagsByType("country")
console.log(countryFlags) // List of all country flags
```

## Types

### FlagType

All flags are categorized into different types, this is also useful when you want to filter flags with the **getFlagsByType** function.

The available flag types:

- "country"
- "region"
- "world"
- "historical"
- "city"
- "symbol"
- "other"

### FlagCode

A union type of all available flag codes. (e.g. "Us", "Fr", "Jp", ...)

### FlagData

Represents the data structure of a flag:

```ts
type FlagData = {
  code: FlagCode
  name: string
  type: FlagType
}
```

## Enum

### FlagsCodesEnum

An enum of all valid flag codes:

```ts
enum FlagsCodesEnum {
  US = "US",
  FR = "FR",
  JP = "JP",
  // ...
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing the Flag Component

You can extend the functionality of the **Flag** component by using additional SVG attributes or wrapping it in your own custom components.

### Example:

```jsx
import Flag from "react-beauty-flags"

const CustomFlag = ({ code }) => (
  <div style={{ border: "1px solid black", display: "inline-block" }}>
    <Flag code={code} width={40} height={40} />
  </div>
)

const App = () => <CustomFlag code="BR" />
export default App
```
