# Documentation

**React Beauty Flags** is a simple React library that renders a handmade flag of a country. It provides an easy way to display flags in your React applications with minimal setup.

## Goal

As a frontend developer, I faced many times the need to display flags in my applications. I found that most libraries available were either **too complex or their designs were not visually appealing**. I wanted to create a set based on beautiful designs that would allow me and any developer to display flags with ease.

As a **Duolingo** user, I was inspired by their flag designs and decided to create a similar feeling for React applications.

You will find +250 flags, including countries, regions, cities, and symbols. The flags are designed with a unique style that makes them visually appealing and easy to recognize.

If you develop a bank or financial application, this might not be the best choice for you. However, if you are building a beautiful with modern UX design, this library is perfect for you. ðŸ˜€

## Installation

To install React Beauty Flags, use your package manager of choice:

```jsx
pnpm install react-beauty-flags
```

You can also use `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add react-beauty-flags
```

```bash
npm install react-beauty-flags
```

## Usage

To use React Beauty Flags in your application, import theÂ **`Flag`**Â component and pass theÂ **`code`**Â prop to specify the country:

```jsx
import Flag from "react-beauty-flags"

const App = () => {
  return <Flag code="Es" />
}

export default App
```

The Flag is rendered by default with a width of **28px** and a height of **20px** (aspect ratio 1.4).

To customize the size, you can pass the **width** and **height** props, even if you can pass all desired sizes, to keep the aspect ratio you can keep this relation (width = height \* 1.4).

To use a scale factor, you can multiply the default size by the desired factor:

```jsx
<Flag code="Es" width={28 * 1.3} height={20 * 1.3} />
```

Also you can pass only the width or height:

```jsx
<Flag code="Es" width={50} /> // This is also valid but the aspect ratio will be different
```

The easier way to change the size is to pass the width and height props directly:

```jsx
<Flag code="Es" width={200} height={140} />
```

## Props

The **Flag** component accepts the following props:

### code Â (required)

- **Type**:Â **FlagCode**
- **Description**: The unique code for the flag you want to display. This should be one of the keys inÂ **`FlagsCodesEnum`**.
- **Example**:

```jsx
<Flag code="Fr" /> // Displays the French flag
```

### Additional SVG Props

TheÂ **Flag**Â component also accepts all standard SVG props, allowing for further customization.

- **Example**:

```jsx
<Flag code="Jp" width={50} height={50} title="Japan Flag" />
```

  </div>
